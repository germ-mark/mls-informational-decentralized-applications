               Distributed and Decentralized Uses of MLS
                      draft-xue-mls-decentralized

Abstract

   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous key
   agreement, and offers additional benefits in multi-device, a.k.a.
   group use cases.  MLS is reliant on a Delivery Service (DS) for
   message ordering.  In highly centralized uses, where the DS is a
   single server, configuration is straightforward.  However, MLS also
   lends itself to use cases that are decentralized (e.g., federated
   networks) and even distributed (e.g., mesh networks).  This
   informational document lays out uses of MLS and its variants and
   extensions across various topologies and provides guidance on
   selection among alternatives under both functionality and security
   considerations.

1.  Introduction

   While the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol had initial uses in
   the construct of simple secure messaging deployments, developments on
   use cases have extended into decentralized and distributed
   environments.  This includes decentralized uses such as federation,
   under the MIMI working group [cite] and distributed uses such as
   across mesh networks.  In such cases, identification of an adequate
   delivery service (DS) to fit various topologies and ensure precise
   commit ordering can be difficult, and the DS can incur significant
   overhead in itself.  This has driven consideration of how to account
   for potential forking of the group state [cite] for re-ordered commit
   messages or avoid the risk of out-of-order commits altogether [cite].
   This informational document provides an outline of uses of MLS and
   its extensions across various network topology considerations, with
   specific considerations to network overhead, storage, and security
   from state forking.

2.  Definitions

   Members: Protocol participants.  Centralized: A centralized network
   has a single server or entity perform the responsibilites of a DS.
   An entity may also be a member.  Decentralized: A decentralized
   network relies on federation of servers or select entites performing
   the responsibilities of a DS.  For example, assigned members may
   coordinate DS responsibilites among themselves.
   Distributed: A distributed network relies on many entities performing
   the responsibilities of a DS.  This may include cases of many members
   or even all members participating in DS responsibilities, such as in
   mesh networks.

3.  Trade-off Considerations

3.1.  MLS

   The MLS protocol is defined in [RFC9420].

3.1.1.  Overhead

   MLS offers logarthimic overhead for groups.

   Additional overhead from the DS must also be accounted for.

3.1.2.  DS

   The centralized case is straightforward in MLS.  For decentralized
   use cases and distributed use cases, care must be taken to identify a
   suitable DS to ensure that there is group consensus on commit
   ordering.  As a use case increases in complexity to the decentralized
   setting and thence to the distributed setting, DS design decisions
   have increasing implications on overhead and potentially also
   security.

   In a decentralized setting, one example solution is to assign one
   server (among a set of federated servers) as the decision holder for
   such ordering, thereby creating a pseudo-centralized environment out
   of a decentralized environment.  In a distributed use case, the
   challenge increases.  Similar temporary role assignment to members,
   where in one is dedicated as a the "lead" entity for deciding commit
   ordering may be possible in well-connected use cases.

   Another approach is hierarchical ordering of commits, e.g., where
   each member is assigned an order in which to commit a PCS update.
   This eases the complexity of the DS, but can create considerations on
   length of PCS windows, especially if a member is offline.  Handling
   of Adds and Removes must also be accounted for.

   Yet a further approach is that of using a consensus algorithm to
   reach agreement on commit ordering.  This offloads overhead to the DS
   as such consensus algorithms can vary wideline in incurred overhead
   and delay for processing, especially if a member is unreachable.

   Thus maintaining consensus on commit ordering tends to incur
   increasing DS overhead has network topology spreads.

3.1.3.  Resiliency

   MLS is heavily dependent on commit ordering being processed in the
   correct sequence.  Out-of-order commits can lead to forks in the
   group state.

3.2.  DeMLS

   In MLS, retention of a group state after applying a commit is
   strongly discouraged, because it compromises the protocol's forward
   secrecy.  As such, clients can't process out-of-order commits,
   because the group state is deleted after the first commit is applied.

   DeMLS (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kohbrok-mls-dmls/) is a
   variant of MLS that achieves fork resilience as introduced by Alwen
   et al. (https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/394), which significantly
   improves forward secrecy when retaining a group state after applying
   a commit.

   The main difference between MLS and DeMLS is how the init_secret is
   derived in the key schedule.  Instead of a regular KDF, DeMLS uses a
   puncturable pseudorandom function (PPRF), which prevents the client
   from deriving the same init_secret twice, thus achieving forward
   secrecy for each specific commit.

3.2.1.  Overhead

   As DeMLS is largely the same as MLS, it retains its performance
   characteristics with the exception of local storage.  Here, the PPRF
   used by DeMLS incurs a local storage overhead on the order of 10 kB
   (depending slightly on the PPRF implementation) per commit processed
   (if the old group state is retained).  The only other place where
   DeMLS differs from MLS is that an extra 32B epoch identifier needs to
   be attached to every message to identify the exact group state
   required to process the message.

3.2.2.  DS

   Its fork resilience makes DeMLS generally suitable for use in
   environments where the DS can't prevent the ocurrence of out-of-order
   commits.

   However, due to the overhead associated with commit processing, DeMLS
   benefits from a DS that can inform clients when out-of-order
   processing may be necessary.

   For example, in federated environments, individual servers can detect
   when they lose connectivity with other parts of the network and
   inform clients that they may need to process multiple commits for the
   current epoch.  Similarly, the server can inform its clients when a
   given netsplit is over and old group states can be deleted.

3.2.3.  Resiliency

   DeMLS makes it safer to maintain multiple forks of a group at the
   added cost of storage, as well as a slight complexity increase in
   MLS's key schedule.  This makes the use of MLS viable in environments
   where forks may occur due to out-of-order commits.

3.3.  DiMLS (Mark)

   DiMLS is defined in....

3.3.1.  Overhead

   DiMLS overhead has linear update overhead.  However, it is not
   dependent on the DS for commit ordering, reducing the DS overhead
   requirements.  For example, a consensus on commit ordering is not
   required for the DS unlike in MLS.  Thus the trade-off in DiMLS is
   among overhead incurred by the security protocol itself and its
   architectural requirements in DS overhead.

3.3.2.  DS

   In DiMLS there are fewer requirements on the DS for exact ordering.
   Messages must get to the respective destinations but in-order
   delivery is not expected for security purposes of maintaining a
   consistent state.

3.3.3.  Resiliency

   DeMLS is highly resilient to out-of-order commits and, in the case of
   honest members, forking of the group state is not possible.  This is
   because each member has full control of commit ordering as it relates
   to the keying state protecting the messages that member sends.

4.  Use Cases

   The basic MLS protocol functions well in environments where reliable
   in-order delivery can be assured.  That includes both centralized
   environment as well as those in decentralized and distributed uses
   where the DS overhead for e.g., consensus is deemed supportable.

   For cases of minor network topology spread, e.g., decentralized uses
   such as federated servers, DeMLS can provide improvements to fork
   resiliency at minor costs to storage.

   For distributed environments where significant changes in network
   topologies are expected, e.g., mesh networks, or where memory storage
   is a consideration, DiMLS offers advantages.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document covers security considerations for various applications
   of other documents to and including MLS.  This document is not an
   exhaustive security reference for use of MLS in decentralized or
   distributed environments, but focuses on the issue of state forking
   in such use cases.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
