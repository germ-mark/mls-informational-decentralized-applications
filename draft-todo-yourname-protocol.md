--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous key agreement, 
and offers additional benefits in multi-device, a.k.a. group use cases. MLS 
is reliant on a Delivery Service (DS) for message ordering. In highly 
centralized uses, where the DS is a single server, configuration is 
straightforward. However, MLS also lends itself to use cases that are 
decentralized (e.g., federated networks) and even distributed (e.g., mesh 
networks). This informational document lays out uses of MLS and its variants 
and extensions across various topologies and provides guidance on selection 
among alternatives.
